# Nickel Language Specification

This directory hosts the specifications of different parts of the Nickel core
language. It is currently limited to ongoing work on the type system and the
typechecking algorithm, but is intended to eventually cover syntax as well as
the operational semantics of Nickel. As opposed to RFCs or other kind of
technical documentation, specifications don't include motivation or
justification, but are extensive and usually formal descriptions of the current
model of the language.
